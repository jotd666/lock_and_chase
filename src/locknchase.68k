* make sure you call "cpu_init" first so bits 8-15 of data registers
* are zeroed out so we can use (ax,dy.w) addressing mode
* without systematic masking
*
* WARNING: you also have to add clr.w d1 and clr.w d2
* at start of any interrupt you could hook
* we don't want to mask those at each X,Y indexed instruction
* for performance reasons
