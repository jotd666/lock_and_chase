- clock is 56,75HZ not 60: compare game speeds MAME/conversion
- find "game is playing" flag to insert coin with fire
  acually doesn't work with $4
- hw sprites are flickering/main character disappearing
- save highscores

  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page
- review/remove all useless set_xc_flags/push/pop sr (290 occurrences) manually
  then keep only the ones useful (automatize?): in progress:
  can we get rid of ALL occurrences to make a unique 68000/020 exe
  
log sound:

wpset 9002,1,W,,{print A;g}
