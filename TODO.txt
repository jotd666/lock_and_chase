- score has strange chars: wrong abcd?
- hw sprites are flickering/main character disappearing
- rip sounds
- cannot use action to close gate anymore??
- implement fast/slow game mode (option)
- enemies are super-slow
- rip music
- save highscores
- find "game is playing" flag to insert coin with fire

optim:

- last post_processing phase / directly in converter: change move.b dx,(a0) / move.b (a0),dx after a GET_ADDRESS or such
  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page
- review/remove all useless push/pop sr (290 occurrences) manually
  then keep only the ones useful (automatic)
