- after highscore entry, character remains jumping and it locks up
  break at e6c6 see what is done with timer 5D/5E
- clock is 56,75HZ not 60
- rip other loop sounds
- RETEST: when killed, sometimes loop not stopped (after bag sound,
  which is also a loop). Probably because loop switched from 16
  to 17 without stopping, so ignored, so not found...
- e984: POP_SR not removed just here (anywhere else ok...)
- converter: after cmp, scan branch until no branch instruction
  not only the first one:

EA66: CD 02 7C cmp $7c02
EA69: F0 0A    beq $ea75
EA6B: 90 05    bcc $ea72

- find "game is playing" flag to insert coin with fire
  acually doesn't work with $4
- hw sprites are flickering/main character disappearing
- when picking bag sfx go crazy (2 sfx is repeated a lot)
  then loop stop is not working anymore:
  better: record both sounds together and ignore sound 2

- save highscores


optim:

- last post_processing phase / directly in converter: change move.b dx,(a0) / move.b (a0),dx after a GET_ADDRESS or such
  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page
- review/remove all useless push/pop sr (290 occurrences) manually
  then keep only the ones useful (automatic)
  
log sound:

wpset 9002,1,W,,{print A;g}

skip:

bpset D9ED,A==$16||A==$17,{PC=$D9F0;g}

replace credit sound by another sound:

bpset C069,,{A=$17;g}
