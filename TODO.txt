- clock is 56,75HZ not 60: compare game speeds MAME/conversion
- release mode is crashing badly (in whdload)
- find "game is playing" flag to insert coin with fire
  acually doesn't work with $4
- at c831, can write to ROM??? at C7E9 (happens when drawing fence)
  actually seems systematic if game wants to close a gate on the
  last row near the exit. Bug also present on the original game
