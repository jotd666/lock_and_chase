- E1B8 wrong, leads to wrong pointer loaded in A5

- sprites mirror probably not working (generate
   hw sprites mirrored!)
- hw sprites are flickering
- erase bobs not implemented  
- implement read_system atm returns FF, probably what prevents demo from starting
- D494 lockup when inserting coin

optim:

- last post_processing phase / directly in converter: change move.b dx,(a0) / move.b (a0),dx after a GET_ADDRESS or such
  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page
- review/remove all useless push/pop sr (290 occurrences) manually
  then keep only the ones useful (automatic)
