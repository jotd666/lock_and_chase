- 3D83 (written in D3DA) cop 98 99  doesn't display
  (char bank 2) debug!
- sprites not working, mirror probably not working
  game reads in 7C00 for sprites not 3C00

- implement read_system atm returns FF
- D494 lockup when inserting coin
- char erase doesn't work

- last post_processing phase: change move.b dx,(a0) / move.b (a0),dx after a GET_ADDRESS or such
  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page

  then keep only the ones useful (automatic)
