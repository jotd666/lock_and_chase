- sprites not working, mirror probably not working
  game reads in 7C00 for sprites not 3C00
  using 7C00 causes mega crash :)
  
- implement read_system atm returns FF, probably what prevents demo from starting
- D494 lockup when inserting coin
- implement sprites (inc. hw sprites attached for guards)
- dual playfield tiles/sprites

optim:

- last post_processing phase / directly in converter: change move.b dx,(a0) / move.b (a0),dx after a GET_ADDRESS or such
  by direct (a6,a0.w) in zero page
- review/remove all useless push/pop sr (290 occurrences) manually
  then keep only the ones useful (automatic)
